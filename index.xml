      <title>Into Texting</title>

      <description>I think the best way to get into writing is by texting. Recently, I texted a lot to express my ideas and stories to a friend. And it&amp;rsquo;s refreshing. Vague thoughts that you buried in your brain become clearer. Suddenly you understand yourself better. Under the pressure of expression, scattering bit of information that you hold crystallizes to sentences. Or just a sentence. A word! Unlike writing, the act of texting segmentize your cloud of thoughts to different sacs that can be combined into different sentences.</description>

      <title>Levenshtein Distance</title>

      <description>In one of my project, I had to make a matching solution for customers in 2 different, unconnected tables. At the beginning, I did the string comparison on customer names, but the plan failed before it even started. People make mistake, and one typo will render the string comparison useless.
The next best thing that I could think of (and actually implemented) is using Levenshtein Distance to calculate the similarity and suggest the best match.</description>

      <title>To Become Lazy</title>

      <description>There was a story that Bill Gates personally prefer lazy people for important jobs at Microsoft because they can give brilliant solutions. As humorous as it is, there is a reliable lesson that we can learn from it.
In any kind of work, &amp;ldquo;make it a habit&amp;rdquo; is one way to improve efficiency. It reduces the &amp;ldquo;unnecessary&amp;rdquo; thinking part that decelerates the decision making. It also increases the synchronization of body parts.</description>

      <description>From my experience working on Web, there are four elements of building web: Databases management, Back end services, front end functionality and front end designer. To be a competent developer, one must cover all of those fields; to be a successful developer, on must cover all of those fields and have deep knowledge in one of them.</description>

      <description>Finally, I got myself a personal blog/website using Hugo Framework. It&amp;rsquo;s been a little bit time consuming to set up, but oh boy isn&amp;rsquo;t it look nice. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to have a personal blog, but not until recently, I realized that I truly want to have a blog.
Last year, I made a website for the sole purpose of getting to the employer&amp;rsquo;s eyes and it didn&amp;rsquo;t get me far.</description>
